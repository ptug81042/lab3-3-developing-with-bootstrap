## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) for layout, grid, and utility classes
- Bootstrap's card component for simplified markup and styling
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) font

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to:
- Use Bootstrap's grid system and utility classes to center and space content responsively.
- Simplify markup and layout using Bootstrap's card component.
- Use CSS custom properties for consistent color theming.
- Apply a mobile-first approach for responsive design.
- Use Google Fonts and follow a provided style guide for typography.

Here is a snippet of the updated HTML structure using Bootstrap:

```html
<div class="container min-vh-100 d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">
  <div class="row w-100">
    <div class="col-12 col-sm-8 col-md-6 col-lg-4 mx-auto">
      <main class="card shadow p-4 text-center">
        <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code" class="card-img-top rounded mb-3" />
        <div class="card-body">
          <h1 class="card-title h5 fw-bold mb-3">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
          <p class="card-text text-secondary mb-0">
            Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level
          </p>
        </div>
      </main>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:
- Explore using CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels and better focus states.
- Experiment with subtle CSS animations for enhanced UI feedback.
